# Purpose of the application

This is the main webpage that will provide the first impression about me for anyone that hasn't had the opportunity to know me.  It shows some very high level information, show my portfolio of work, and provide a way to contact me.  More than a data providing website, this website will provide a hint of what is important to me, my value, my though process and philosophy about life in general.


## Functionality

The application is supposed to be clean yet informative, minimalistic without omiting important facts, easy to navigate.

A white and black background was chosen to avoid saturation of effects.  Color is reserved to accentuate pictures, navigation tabs and the submit button on the contact information page.

Font chosen is not as formal to project a carefree approach to life.

Ghandi quote is prominent and visible at all times to provide the fundamental guiding principle about how I live my life.  Contact information is visible at all times so that it is handy if a direct contact is desired.

## About me tab

Provide information about where I live (geography), my family, my background, and overall what I like to do.

## Links tab

Provides links to my PDF resume, LinkedIn, Github, and other sites of interest.

## Portfolio tab

It includes all of the homework (excluding first two) that have been done over the length of the course, including the group project.  It includes a picture depicting what the application is about, a text description and a button.  Upon clicking the button, a new tab is opened and the application is oppened.  The applications are hosted by Github.

## Contact tab

The contact tab allows people to send a message and provide information about themselves.  Three data elements are needed and validated:  Name, e-mail and message.

Name has to be at least as three characters such as Tom, Marc, Tim, etc.

email has to be a valid syntax.  Currently, the application does not check that the email actually exists, just that it conforms to e-mail naming standards.

Finally, the message has to be at least 10 characters long.

If any of the three parameters is invalid, once the submit button is clicked, a pop-up will show and indicate whether something is valid or not.

If all of the three data elements are valid, the program will thank the user, and will write the message to local storage.
